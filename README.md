# CTS256-SP0256
Single Board Computer featuring a vintage General Instrument CTS256A-AL2 Code-to-Speech Processing chip and SP0256 Narratorâ„¢ Speech Processor with 4K exception EPROM and 8K RAM buffer.
'speak.asm' is an application for the CTS256 that allows you to enter allophones to the SP0256 which are pronounced as a word. I find it useful when creating new exception words for testing different combinations of allophones to find which sound the best.
