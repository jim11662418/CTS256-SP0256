# CTS256-SP0256
Single Board Computer featuring a vintage General Instrument CTS256A-AL2 Code-to-Speech Processing chip and SP0256 Narratorâ„¢ Speech Processor with 4K exception EPROM and 8K RAM buffer.
'speak.asm' is an application I've written for the CTS256 that allows you to send a set of allophones to the SP0256 to be spoken as a word. I find it useful when for testing allophone combinations when creating new exception words.
